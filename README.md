My bachelor's degree project: A 2D roguelike shoot 'em up game made in Unity with C#. You can choose between a variety of weapons with different styles and passives that amplify either
your characther or weapons stats. You need to survive against waves of different enemies that change every 60 seconds, with random events appearing after the first 2 minutes.
